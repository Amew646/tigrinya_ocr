Kraken Issues::
0. Overall Kraken is a joy to use, especially compared to Tesseract. The API is clean, modular and only exposes important options. The docs layout an end to end workflow for usage and training, with great defaults. I also want to try swapping in calamari ocr for the model.
1. Haven't tested the accuracy yet, but it seems like kraken produces small models that are sample efficient but more specialized to specific fonts. Will the network be large enough to handle the large number of Ge'ez glyphs (~300)? I plan on training from scratch with a large corpus (~100pg) that includes all of the english letters. From there I will fine tune for specific fonts. Combine with degradation options and possibly one other font for more data.
2. Need to word wrap corpus before generating synthetic data. Python script for unicode support.
3. Script detection is currently broken. Will jointly train for Tigrinya and English for now.
4. There's a bug with CUDA 9.0, python 3.6 and Pytorch.
5. The new type suggestions require python 3.6, which requires a few hacks to work on ubuntu 16.04.

Tesseract Issues::
0. Overall Tesseract is very hard to use and poorly documented (at least for the 4.0 version that offers LSTM support). Also there doesn't seem to be a straightforward default route for training a new model. Finally, the ML engine is all custom, which seems ridiculous and hard to work with.
1. The default tir model seems to be ~70% accurate on my training data. It seems like Tesseract's model could be accurate and generalizable, but at the cost of tons of data.
2. tesstrain.sh: can't generate tif/box files for certain fonts in combination. However, when separate it seems to work.
3. lstmeval: fails to encode transcription for a bunch of valid lines
Eval Char error rate=1.9199812, Word error rate=4.7033258
4. Is tir.config needed? 
5. These fonts don't seem to work
Please correct --font arg.
